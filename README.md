# Malware

### Disclaimer

This repository is one of the few malware collections on GitHub. Almost every sample here is malicious so I strongly recommend you to neither open these files on real hardware, nor misuse the malware to prank your friends. Playing with these samples may lead to irreversible consequences which may affect anything from personal data to passwords and banking information.

**_I am not responsible for any damage caused by the malware inside my repository and your negligence in general._**
